## General comments and feedback
Here's some of the feedback we received.
* *"Just thank you all, You're amazing humans."*
* *"I look forward to the events and the information shared. My schedule is often a challenge as I have to care for my youngest son (physically disabled). I would love to get more involved and see the meet ups grow. I would also love to see if any interest in participating with Google Local Guides Wheelchair Accessibility updates. Planning an outing with my son to get him started in advocacy and recognizing opportunities to make changes early on."*
* *"I just started going - but I was so impressed with my first event...very well organized and you clearly take the purpose to heart. I so look forward to the next one!"*
* *"I love that you also broadcast the events in youtube for us remote people"*
* *"Offered help in past - guess u have to be developer. Interested in more inclusive groups/solutions vs Just IT focus/approaches. This is a dev meet up for programmers but I attend to meet and interact with humans dealing with accessibility challenges and working on resolving them."*
* *"It's been really great seeing the likes of Marcy Sutton and Derek Featherstone giving presentations as well as everyone else who have presented. You guys have done an awesome job organizing and getting a lot of good info about A11y out and I'm very appreciative of all your hard work in doing so."*
* *"I love your mission and the quality of the presentations. The venues lately have been excellent. Since I like meeting people, I don't like "classroom" type setups (i.e. Critical Mass) b/c people sit down and don't mix much."*
* *"I really like the idea of demos. i don't know many of the tools and would love to get a demonstration of the various tools people used based on disability. I also like the idea of design considerations for accessibility. How development can solve (without getting way too deep within the weeds of code). What I do appreciate though are the callouts for upcoming events outside of this meetup at the end however."*
* *"I'd love to do some projects for people with disabilities or an organization that needs pro-bono work. Seems like there are enough designers and developers that could actually give back to the community."*
* *"I wish to influence technology and visually impaired input."*
* *"Thank you, Dennis and Nick, for all you do to keep the conversations on accessibility going!"*
* *"The only way for me to addend the meetings currently is online via webinar format"*
* *"Great Meetups."*
